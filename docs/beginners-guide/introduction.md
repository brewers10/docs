# Introduction

Welcome to our beginner's guide! This guide aims to help you get started with the aircraft and is mostly tailored towards beginners. We will go over all the required procedures for all stages of flight. After following this guide, you will be able to perform a standard flight from A-B.

This guide assumes that you have basic knowledge of aviation terminology.

## OFP

For the sake of consistency, we recommend you fly a set route which the guide will be following. In order to make sure you learn everything you need to operate the aircraft, particularly the fuel system which requires manual intervention after cruising for a longer time, this route will be *fairly long*. Download the SimBrief OFP [here].

You are now ready to load into the aircraft in-game and move onto the next section, where we will be powering up the aircraft!
